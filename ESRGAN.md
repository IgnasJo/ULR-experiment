Abstract. The Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SR-
GAN) [1] is a seminal work that is capable of generating realistic textures
during single image super-resolution. However, the hallucinated details
are often accompanied with unpleasant artifacts. To further enhance the
visual quality, we thoroughly study three key components of SRGAN –
network architecture, adversarial loss and perceptual loss, and improve
each of them to derive an Enhanced SRGAN (ESRGAN). In particu-
lar, we introduce the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) without
batch normalization as the basic network building unit. Moreover, we
borrow the idea from relativistic GAN [2] to let the discriminator predict
relative realness instead of the absolute value. Finally, we improve the
perceptual loss by using the features before activation, which could pro-
vide stronger supervision for brightness consistency and texture recovery.
Beneﬁting from these improvements, the proposed ESRGAN achieves
consistently better visual quality with more realistic and natural textures
than SRGAN and won the ﬁrst place in the PIRM2018-SR Challenge1 [3].

1 Introduction

Single image super-resolution (SISR), as a fundamental low-level vision prob-
lem, has attracted increasing attention in the research community and AI com-
panies. SISR aims at recovering a high-resolution (HR) image from a single
low-resolution (LR) one. Since the pioneer work of SRCNN proposed by Dong
et al. [4], deep convolution neural network (CNN) approaches have brought pros-
perous development. Various network architecture designs and training strategies
have continuously improved the SR performance, especially the Peak Signal-to-
Noise Ratio (PSNR) value [5,6,7,1,8,9,10,11,12]. However, these PSNR-oriented
approaches tend to output over-smoothed results without suﬃcient high-frequency
details, since the PSNR metric fundamentally disagrees with the subjective eval-
uation of human observers [1].

1 We won the ﬁrst place in region 3 and got the best perceptual index.

and the ground-truth. ESRGAN outperforms SRGAN in sharpness and details.

Several perceptual-driven methods have been proposed to improve the visual
quality of SR results. For instance, perceptual loss [13,14] is proposed to opti-
mize super-resolution model in a feature space instead of pixel space. Generative
adversarial network [15] is introduced to SR by [1,16] to encourage the network
to favor solutions that look more like natural images. The semantic image prior
is further incorporated to improve recovered texture details [17]. One of the
milestones in the way pursuing visually pleasing results is SRGAN [1]. The basic
model is built with residual blocks [18] and optimized using perceptual loss in a
GAN framework. With all these techniques, SRGAN signiﬁcantly improves the
overall visual quality of reconstruction over PSNR-oriented methods.

However, there still exists a clear gap between SRGAN results and the
ground-truth (GT) images, as shown in Fig. 1. In this study, we revisit the
key components of SRGAN and improve the model in three aspects. First, we
improve the network structure by introducing the Residual-in-Residual Dense
Block (RDDB), which is of higher capacity and easier to train. We also remove
Batch Normalization (BN) [19] layers as in [20] and use residual scaling [21,20]
and smaller initialization to facilitate training a very deep network. Second, we
improve the discriminator using Relativistic average GAN (RaGAN) [2], which
learns to judge "whether one image is more realistic than the other" rather than
"whether one image is real or fake". Our experiments show that this improvement
helps the generator recover more realistic texture details. Third, we propose an
improved perceptual loss by using the VGG features before activation instead of
after activation as in SRGAN. We empirically ﬁnd that the adjusted perceptual
loss provides sharper edges and more visually pleasing results, as will be shown

in Sec. 4.4. Extensive experiments show that the enhanced SRGAN, termed ES-
RGAN, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both sharpness and
details (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 7).

We take a variant of ESRGAN to participate in the PIRM-SR Challenge [3].
This challenge is the ﬁrst SR competition that evaluates the performance in a
perceptual-quality aware manner based on [22], where the authors claim that
distortion and perceptual quality are at odds with each other. The perceptual
quality is judged by the non-reference measures of Ma's score [23] and NIQE [24],
i.e., perceptual index = 1
2 ((10−Ma)+NIQE). A lower perceptual index represents
a better perceptual quality.

As shown in Fig. 2, the perception-distortion plane is divided into three
regions deﬁned by thresholds on the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), and the
algorithm that achieves the lowest perceptual index in each region becomes the
regional champion. We mainly focus on region 3 as we aim to bring the perceptual
quality to a new high. Thanks to the aforementioned improvements and some
other adjustments as discussed in Sec. 4.6, our proposed ESRGAN won the ﬁrst
place in the PIRM-SR Challenge (region 3) with the best perceptual index.

In order to balance the visual quality and RMSE/PSNR, we further propose
the network interpolation strategy, which could continuously adjust the recon-
struction style and smoothness. Another alternative is image interpolation, which
directly interpolates images pixel by pixel. We employ this strategy to partici-
pate in region 1 and region 2. The network interpolation and image interpolation
strategies and their diﬀerences are discussed in Sec. 3.4.

2 Related Work

We focus on deep neural network approaches to solve the SR problem. As a
pioneer work, Dong et al. [4,25] propose SRCNN to learn the mapping from LR

to HR images in an end-to-end manner, achieving superior performance against
previous works. Later on, the ﬁeld has witnessed a variety of network architec-
tures, such as a deeper network with residual learning [5], Laplacian pyramid
structure [6], residual blocks [1], recursive learning [7,8], densely connected
network [9], deep back projection [10] and residual dense network [11]. Speciﬁcally,
Lim et al. [20] propose EDSR model by removing unnecessary BN layers in
the residual block and expanding the model size, which achieves signiﬁcant im-
provement. Zhang et al. [11] propose to use eﬀective residual dense block in SR,
and they further explore a deeper network with channel attention [12], achiev-
ing the state-of-the-art PSNR performance. Besides supervised learning, other
methods like reinforcement learning [26] and unsupervised learning [27] are also
introduced to solve general image restoration problems.

Several methods have been proposed to stabilize training a very deep model.
For instance, residual path is developed to stabilize the training and improve the
performance [18,5,12]. Residual scaling is ﬁrst employed by Szegedy et al. [21]
and also used in EDSR. For general deep networks, He et al. [28] propose a robust
initialization method for VGG-style networks without BN. To facilitate training
a deeper network, we develop a compact and eﬀective residual-in-residual dense
block, which also helps to improve the perceptual quality.

Perceptual-driven approaches have also been proposed to improve the visual
quality of SR results. Based on the idea of being closer to perceptual similar-
ity [29,14], perceptual loss [13] is proposed to enhance the visual quality by min-
imizing the error in a feature space instead of pixel space. Contextual loss [30] is
developed to generate images with natural image statistics by using an objective
that focuses on the feature distribution rather than merely comparing the ap-
pearance. Ledig et al. [1] propose SRGAN model that uses perceptual loss and
adversarial loss to favor outputs residing on the manifold of natural images. Saj-
jadi et al. [16] develop a similar approach and further explored the local texture
matching loss. Based on these works, Wang et al. [17] propose spatial feature
transform to eﬀectively incorporate semantic prior in an image and improve the
recovered textures.

Throughout the literature, photo-realism is usually attained by adversarial
training with GAN [15]. Recently there are a bunch of works that focus on de-
veloping more eﬀective GAN frameworks. WGAN [31] proposes to minimize a
reasonable and eﬃcient approximation of Wasserstein distance and regularizes
discriminator by weight clipping. Other improved regularization for discrimina-
tor includes gradient clipping [32] and spectral normalization [33]. Relativistic
discriminator [2] is developed not only to increase the probability that gener-
ated data are real, but also to simultaneously decrease the probability that real
data are real. In this work, we enhance SRGAN by employing a more eﬀective
relativistic average GAN.

SR algorithms are typically evaluated by several widely used distortion mea-
sures, e.g., PSNR and SSIM. However, these metrics fundamentally disagree with
the subjective evaluation of human observers [1]. Non-reference measures are
used for perceptual quality evaluation, including Ma's score [23] and NIQE [24],

both of which are used to calculate the perceptual index in the PIRM-SR Chal-
lenge [3]. In a recent study, Blau et al. [22] ﬁnd that the distortion and perceptual
quality are at odds with each other.

3 Proposed Methods

Our main aim is to improve the overall perceptual quality for SR. In this sec-
tion, we ﬁrst describe our proposed network architecture and then discuss the
improvements from the discriminator and perceptual loss. At last, we describe
the network interpolation strategy for balancing perceptual quality and PSNR.

Fig. 3: We employ the basic architecture of SRResNet [1], where most computa-
tion is done in the LR feature space. We could select or design "basic blocks"
(e.g., residual block [18], dense block [34], RRDB) for better performance.

3.1 Network Architecture

In order to further improve the recovered image quality of SRGAN, we mainly
make two modiﬁcations to the structure of generator G: 1) remove all BN lay-
ers; 2) replace the original basic block with the proposed Residual-in-Residual
Dense Block (RRDB), which combines multi-level residual network and dense
connections as depicted in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4: Left: We remove the BN layers in residual block in SRGAN. Right:
RRDB block is used in our deeper model and β is the residual scaling parameter.

Removing BN layers has proven to increase performance and reduce com-
putational complexity in diﬀerent PSNR-oriented tasks including SR [20] and
deblurring [35]. BN layers normalize the features using mean and variance in a
batch during training and use estimated mean and variance of the whole train-
ing dataset during testing. When the statistics of training and testing datasets
diﬀer a lot, BN layers tend to introduce unpleasant artifacts and limit the gener-
alization ability. We empirically observe that BN layers are more likely to bring

artifacts when the network is deeper and trained under a GAN framework. These
artifacts occasionally appear among iterations and diﬀerent settings, violating
the needs for a stable performance over training. We therefore remove BN layers
for stable training and consistent performance. Furthermore, removing BN layers
helps to improve generalization ability and to reduce computational complexity
and memory usage.

We keep the high-level architecture design of SRGAN (see Fig. 3), and use a
novel basic block namely RRDB as depicted in Fig. 4. Based on the observation
that more layers and connections could always boost performance [20,11,12], the
proposed RRDB employs a deeper and more complex structure than the original
residual block in SRGAN. Speciﬁcally, as shown in Fig. 4, the proposed RRDB
has a residual-in-residual structure, where residual learning is used in diﬀerent
levels. A similar network structure is proposed in [36] that also applies a multi-
level residual network. However, our RRDB diﬀers from [36] in that we use dense
block [34] in the main path as [11], where the network capacity becomes higher
beneﬁting from the dense connections.

In addition to the improved architecture, we also exploit several techniques
to facilitate training a very deep network: 1) residual scaling [21,20], i.e., scaling
down the residuals by multiplying a constant between 0 and 1 before adding them
to the main path to prevent instability; 2) smaller initialization, as we empirically
ﬁnd residual architecture is easier to train when the initial parameter variance
becomes smaller. More discussion can be found in the supplementary material.
The training details and the eﬀectiveness of the proposed network will be

presented in Sec. 4.

3.2 Relativistic Discriminator

Besides the improved structure of generator, we also enhance the discriminator
based on the Relativistic GAN [2]. Diﬀerent from the standard discriminator D
in SRGAN, which estimates the probability that one input image x is real and
natural, a relativistic discriminator tries to predict the probability that a real
image xr is relatively more realistic than a fake one xf , as shown in Fig. 5.

Fig. 5: Diﬀerence between standard discriminator and relativistic discriminator.

Speciﬁcally, we replace the standard discriminator with the Relativistic av-
erage Discriminator RaD [2], denoted as DRa. The standard discriminator in
SRGAN can be expressed as D(x) = σ(C(x)), where σ is the sigmoid function
and C(x) is the non-transformed discriminator output. Then the RaD is for-
mulated as DRa(xr, xf ) = σ(C(xr) − Exf [C(xf )]), where Exf [·] represents the

operation of taking average for all fake data in the mini-batch. The discriminator
loss is then deﬁned as:

D = −Exr [log(DRa(xr, xf ))] − Exf [log(1 − DRa(xf , xr))].
LRa

(1)

The adversarial loss for generator is in a symmetrical form:

G = −Exr [log(1 − DRa(xr, xf ))] − Exf [log(DRa(xf , xr))],
LRa
where xf = G(xi) and xi stands for the input LR image. It is observed that the
adversarial loss for generator contains both xr and xf . Therefore, our generator
beneﬁts from the gradients from both generated data and real data in adversarial
training, while in SRGAN only generated part takes eﬀect. In Sec. 4.4, we will
show that this modiﬁcation of discriminator helps to learn sharper edges and
more detailed textures.

3.3 Perceptual Loss

We also develop a more eﬀective perceptual loss Lpercep by constraining on fea-
tures before activation rather than after activation as practiced in SRGAN.

Based on the idea of being closer to perceptual similarity [29,14], Johnson
et al. [13] propose perceptual loss and it is extended in SRGAN [1]. Perceptual
loss is previously deﬁned on the activation layers of a pre-trained deep network,
where the distance between two activated features is minimized. Contrary to
the convention, we propose to use features before the activation layers, which
will overcome two drawbacks of the original design. First, the activated features
are very sparse, especially after a very deep network, as depicted in Fig. 6.
For example, the average percentage of activated neurons for image 'baboon'
after VGG19-543 layer is merely 11.17%. The sparse activation provides weak
supervision and thus leads to inferior performance. Second, using features after
activation also causes inconsistent reconstructed brightness compared with the
ground-truth image, which we will show in Sec. 4.4.
Therefore, the total loss for the generator is:

LG = Lpercep + λLRa

(3)
where L1 = Exi||G(xi) − y||1 is the content loss that evaluate the 1-norm dis-
tance between recovered image G(xi) and the ground-truth y, and λ, η are the
coeﬃcients to balance diﬀerent loss terms.

G + ηL1,

We also explore a variant of perceptual loss in the PIRM-SR Challenge. In
contrast to the commonly used perceptual loss that adopts a VGG network
trained for image classiﬁcation, we develop a more suitable perceptual loss for
SR – MINC loss. It is based on a ﬁne-tuned VGG network for material recog-
nition [38], which focuses on textures rather than object. Although the gain of
perceptual index brought by MINC loss is marginal, we still believe that explor-
ing perceptual loss that focuses on texture is critical for SR.

3 We use pre-trained 19-layer VGG network[37], where 54 indicates features obtained
by the 4th convolution before the 5th maxpooling layer, representing high-level fea-
tures and similarly, 22 represents low-level features.

boon'. With the network going deeper, most of the features after activation
become inactive while features before activation contains more information.

3.4 Network Interpolation

To remove unpleasant noise in GAN-based methods while maintain a good per-
ceptual quality, we propose a ﬂexible and eﬀective strategy – network interpola-
tion. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst train a PSNR-oriented network GPSNR and then obtain
a GAN-based network GGAN by ﬁne-tuning. We interpolate all the correspond-
ing parameters of these two networks to derive an interpolated model GINTERP,
whose parameters are:

are the parameters of GINTERP, GPSNR and

G

The proposed network interpolation enjoys two merits. First, the interpo-
lated model is able to produce meaningful results for any feasible α without
introducing artifacts. Second, we can continuously balance perceptual quality
and ﬁdelity without re-training the model.

We also explore alternative methods to balance the eﬀects of PSNR-oriented
and GAN-based methods. For instance, one can directly interpolate their output
images (pixel by pixel) rather than the network parameters. However, such an
approach fails to achieve a good trade-oﬀ between noise and blur, i.e., the inter-
polated image is either too blurry or noisy with artifacts (see Sec. 4.5). Another
method is to tune the weights of content loss and adversarial loss, i.e., the pa-
rameter λ and η in Eq. (3). But this approach requires tuning loss weights and
ﬁne-tuning the network, and thus it is too costly to achieve continuous control
of the image style.

4 Experiments

4.1 Training Details

Following SRGAN [1], all experiments are performed with a scaling factor of
×4 between LR and HR images. We obtain LR images by down-sampling HR

images using the MATLAB bicubic kernel function. The mini-batch size is set to
16. The spatial size of cropped HR patch is 128 × 128. We observe that training
a deeper network beneﬁts from a larger patch size, since an enlarged receptive
ﬁeld helps to capture more semantic information. However, it costs more training
time and consumes more computing resources. This phenomenon is also observed
in PSNR-oriented methods (see supplementary material ).

The training process is divided into two stages. First, we train a PSNR-
oriented model with the L1 loss. The learning rate is initialized as 2 × 10−4 and
decayed by a factor of 2 every 2 × 105 of mini-batch updates. We then employ
the trained PSNR-oriented model as an initialization for the generator. The
generator is trained using the loss function in Eq. (3) with λ = 5 × 10−3 and η =
1×10−2. The learning rate is set to 1×10−4 and halved at [50k, 100k, 200k, 300k]
iterations. Pre-training with pixel-wise loss helps GAN-based methods to obtain
more visually pleasing results. The reasons are that 1) it can avoid undesired
local optima for the generator; 2) after pre-training, the discriminator receives
relatively good super-resolved images instead of extreme fake ones (black or
noisy images) at the very beginning, which helps it to focus more on texture
discrimination.

For optimization, we use Adam [39] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999. We alternately
update the generator and discriminator network until the model converges. We
use two settings for our generator – one of them contains 16 residual blocks,
with a capacity similar to that of SRGAN and the other is a deeper model with
23 RRDB blocks. We implement our models with the PyTorch framework and
train them using NVIDIA Titan Xp GPUs.

4.2 Data

For training, we mainly use the DIV2K dataset [40], which is a high-quality (2K
resolution) dataset for image restoration tasks. Beyond the training set of DIV2K
that contains 800 images, we also seek for other datasets with rich and diverse
textures for our training. To this end, we further use the Flickr2K dataset [41]
consisting of 2650 2K high-resolution images collected on the Flickr website,
and the OutdoorSceneTraining (OST) [17] dataset to enrich our training set.
We empirically ﬁnd that using this large dataset with richer textures helps the
generator to produce more natural results, as shown in Fig. 8.

We train our models in RGB channels and augment the training dataset
with random horizontal ﬂips and 90 degree rotations. We evaluate our mod-
els on widely used benchmark datasets – Set5 [42], Set14 [43], BSD100 [44],
Urban100 [45], and the PIRM self-validation dataset that is provided in the
PIRM-SR Challenge.

4.3 Qualitative Results

We compare our ﬁnal models on several public benchmark datasets with state-of-
the-art PSNR-oriented methods including SRCNN [4], EDSR [20] and RCAN [12],
and also with perceptual-driven approaches including SRGAN [1] and EnhanceNet

[16]. Since there is no eﬀective and standard metric for perceptual quality, we
present some representative qualitative results in Fig. 7. PSNR (evaluated on
the luminance channel in YCbCr color space) and the perceptual index used in
the PIRM-SR Challenge are also provided for reference.

It can be observed from Fig. 7 that our proposed ESRGAN outperforms
previous approaches in both sharpness and details. For instance, ESRGAN can
produce sharper and more natural baboon's whiskers and grass textures (see
image 43074) than PSNR-oriented methods, which tend to generate blurry re-
sults, and than previous GAN-based methods, whose textures are unnatural and
contain unpleasing noise. ESRGAN is capable of generating more detailed struc-
tures in building (see image 102061) while other methods either fail to produce
enough details (SRGAN) or add undesired textures (EnhanceNet). Moreover,
previous GAN-based methods sometimes introduce unpleasant artifacts, e.g.,
SRGAN adds wrinkles to the face. Our ESRGAN gets rid of these artifacts and
produces natural results.

4.4 Ablation Study

In order to study the eﬀects of each component in the proposed ESRGAN, we
gradually modify the baseline SRGAN model and compare their diﬀerences.
The overall visual comparison is illustrated in Fig. 8. Each column represents
a model with its conﬁgurations shown in the top. The red sign indicates the
main improvement compared with the previous model. A detailed discussion is
provided as follows.
BN removal. We ﬁrst remove all BN layers for stable and consistent perfor-
mance without artifacts. It does not decrease the performance but saves the
computational resources and memory usage. For some cases, a slight improve-
ment can be observed from the 2nd and 3rd columns in Fig. 8 (e.g., image 39).
Furthermore, we observe that when a network is deeper and more complicated,
the model with BN layers is more likely to introduce unpleasant artifacts. The
examples can be found in the supplementary material.
Before activation in perceptual loss. We ﬁrst demonstrate that using fea-
tures before activation can result in more accurate brightness of reconstructed
images. To eliminate the inﬂuences of textures and color, we ﬁlter the image with
a Gaussian kernel and plot the histogram of its gray-scale counterpart. Fig. 9a
shows the distribution of each brightness value. Using activated features skews
the distribution to the left, resulting in a dimmer output while using features
before activation leads to a more accurate brightness distribution closer to that
of the ground-truth.

We can further observe that using features before activation helps to produce
sharper edges and richer textures as shown in Fig. 9b (see bird feather) and Fig. 8
(see the 3rd and 4th columns), since the dense features before activation oﬀer a
stronger supervision than that a sparse activation could provide.
RaGAN. RaGAN uses an improved relativistic discriminator, which is shown
to beneﬁt learning sharper edges and more detailed textures. For example, in

the 5th column of Fig. 8, the generated images are sharper with richer textures
than those on their left (see the baboon, image 39 and image 43074).
Deeper network with RRDB. Deeper model with the proposed RRDB can
further improve the recovered textures, especially for the regular structures like
the roof of image 6 in Fig. 8, since the deep model has a strong representation
capacity to capture semantic information. Also, we ﬁnd that a deeper model can
reduce unpleasing noises like image 20 in Fig. 8.

In contrast to SRGAN, which claimed that deeper models are increasingly
diﬃcult to train, our deeper model shows its superior performance with easy
training, thanks to the improvements mentioned above especially the proposed
RRDB without BN layers.

4.5 Network Interpolation

We compare the eﬀects of network interpolation and image interpolation strate-
gies in balancing the results of a PSNR-oriented model and GAN-based method.
We apply simple linear interpolation on both the schemes. The interpolation
parameter α is chosen from 0 to 1 with an interval of 0.2.

As depicted in Fig. 10, the pure GAN-based method produces sharp edges
and richer textures but with some unpleasant artifacts, while the pure PSNR-
oriented method outputs cartoon-style blurry images. By employing network
interpolation, unpleasing artifacts are reduced while the textures are maintained.
By contrast, image interpolation fails to remove these artifacts eﬀectively.

Interestingly, it is observed that the network interpolation strategy provides

a smooth control of balancing perceptual quality and ﬁdelity in Fig. 10.

4.6 The PIRM-SR Challenge

We take a variant of ESRGAN to participate in the PIRM-SR Challenge [3].
Speciﬁcally, we use the proposed ESRGAN with 16 residual blocks and also em-
pirically make some modiﬁcations to cater to the perceptual index. 1) The MINC
loss is used as a variant of perceptual loss, as discussed in Sec. 3.3. Despite the
marginal gain on the perceptual index, we still believe that exploring perceptual
loss that focuses on texture is critical for SR. 2) Pristine dataset [24], which is

used for learning the perceptual index, is also employed in our training; 3) a
high weight of loss L1 up to η = 10 is used due to the PSNR constraints; 4) we
also use back projection [46] as post-processing, which can improve PSNR and
sometimes lower the perceptual index.

For other regions 1 and 2 that require a higher PSNR, we use image in-
terpolation between the results of our ESRGAN and those of a PSNR-oriented
method RCAN [12]. The image interpolation scheme achieves a lower perceptual
index (lower is better) although we observed more visually pleasing results by
using the network interpolation scheme. Our proposed ESRGAN model won the
ﬁrst place in the PIRM-SR Challenge (region 3) with the best perceptual index.

5 Conclusion

We have presented an ESRGAN model that achieves consistently better per-
ceptual quality than previous SR methods. The method won the ﬁrst place in
the PIRM-SR Challenge in terms of the perceptual index. We have formulated
a novel architecture containing several RDDB blocks without BN layers. In ad-
dition, useful techniques including residual scaling and smaller initialization are
employed to facilitate the training of the proposed deep model. We have also
introduced the use of relativistic GAN as the discriminator, which learns to
judge whether one image is more realistic than another, guiding the generator
to recover more detailed textures. Moreover, we have enhanced the perceptual
loss by using the features before activation, which oﬀer stronger supervision and
thus restore more accurate brightness and realistic textures.

Abstract. In this supplementary ﬁle, we ﬁrst show more examples of
Batch-Normalization (BN) related artifacts in Section 1. Then we intro-
duce several useful techniques that facilitate training very deep models in
Section 2. The analysis of the inﬂuence of diﬀerent datasets and training
patch size is depicted in Section 3 and Section 4, respectively. Finally, in
Section 5, we provide more qualitative results for visual comparison.

1 BN artifacts

We empirically observe that BN layers tend to bring artifacts. These artifacts,
namely BN artifacts, occasionally appear among iterations and diﬀerent settings,
violating the needs for a stable performance over training. In this section, we
present that the network depth, BN position, training dataset and training loss
have impact on the occurrence of BN artifacts and show corresponding visual
examples in Fig. 1, 2 and 3.

To explore BN artifacts, we conduct several experiments as shown in Tab. 1.
The baseline is similar to SRResNet [1] with 16 Residual Blocks (RB) and all
the BN layers are in the LR space, i.e., before up-sampling layers. The baseline
setting is unlikely to introduce BN artifacts in our experiments. However, if
the network goes deeper or there is an extra BN layer in HR space (i.e., after
up-sampling layers), BN artifacts are more likely to appear (see examples in
Fig. 1).

When we replace the training dataset of the baseline with the sky dataset [17],
the BN artifacts appear (see examples in Fig. 1). BN layers normalize the features

using mean and variance in a batch during training while using estimated mean
and variance of the whole training dataset during testing. Therefore, when the
statistics of training (e.g., sky dataset) and testing datasets diﬀer a lot, BN layers
tend to introduce unpleasant artifacts and limit the generalization ability.

Training in a GAN framework increases the occurrence probability of BN
artifacts in our experiments. We employ the same network structure as baseline
and replace the L1 loss with V GG + GAN + L1 loss. The BN artifacts become
more likely to appear and the visual examples are shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2: Examples of BN artifacts in models under the GAN framework.

The BN artifacts occasionally appear over training, i.e, the BN artifacts
appear, disappear and change on diﬀerent training iterations, as shown in Fig 3.
We therefore remove BN layers for stable training and consistent performance.
The reasons behind and potential solutions remain to be further studied.

2 Useful techniques to train a very deep network

Since we remove BN layers for stable training and consistent performance, train-
ing a very deep network becomes a problem. Despite the proposed Residual-in-
Residual Dense Block (RRDB), which takes advantages of residual learning and
more connections, we also ﬁnd two useful techniques to ease the training of a
very deep networks – smaller initialization and residual scaling.

training progress.The BN artifacts occasionally appear over training, resulting
in unstable performance.

Initialization is important for a very deep network especially without BN lay-
ers [47,28]. He et al. [28] propose a robust initialization method, namely MSRA
initialization, that is suitable for VGG-style network (plain network without
residual connections). The assumption is that a proper initialization method
should avoid reducing or magnifying the magnitudes of input signals exponen-
tially. It is worth noting that this assumption no longer holds due to the residual
path in ResNet [18], leading to a magniﬁed magnitudes of input signals. This
problem is alleviated by normalizing the features with BN layers [19]. For a very
deep network containing residual blocks without BN layers, a new initialization
method should be applied. We ﬁnd a smaller initialization than MSRA initializa-
tion (multiplying 0.1 for all initialization parameters that calculated by MSRA
initialization) works well in our experiments.

Another method for training deeper networks is residual learning, proposed
by Szegedy et al. [21] and also used in used in EDSR [20]. It scales down the
residuals by multiplying a constant between 0 and 1 before adding them to
the main path to prevent instability. In our settings, for each residual block, the
residual features after the last convolution layer are multiplied by 0.2. Intuitively,
the residual scaling can be interpreted to correct the improper initialization, thus
avoiding magnifying the magnitudes of input signals in residual networks.

We use a very deep network containing 64 RBs for experiments. As shown
in Fig. 4a, if we simply use MSRA initialization, the network falls into an ex-
tremely bad local minimum with poor performance. However, smaller initializa-
tion (×0.1) helps the network to jump out the bad local minimum and achieve
good performance. The zoomed curves are shown in Fig. 4b. Smaller initializa-
tion achieves a higher PSNR than residual scaling. In addition, we can use both
techniques to further obtain a slight improvement.

3 The inﬂuence of different datasets

First we show that larger datasets lead to better performance for PSNR-oriented
methods. We use a large model, where 23 Residual-in-Residual Blocks (RRDB)
are placed before the upsampling layer followed by two convolution layers for
reconstruction. The overall comparison of quantitative evaluation can be found
in Tab. 2.

A widely used training dataset is DIV2K [40] that contains 800 images. We
also explore other datasets with more diverse scenes – Flickr2K dataset [41]
consisting of 2650 2K high-resolution images collected on the Flickr website. It
is observed that the merged dataset with DIV2K and Flickr2K, namely DF2K
dataset, increases the PSNR performance (see Tab. 2).

For perceptual-driven methods that focus on texture restoration, we further
enrich the training set with OutdoorSceneTraining (OST) [17] dataset with di-
verse natural textures. We employ the large model with 23 RRDB blocks. A
subset of ImageNet containing about 450k images is also used for comparison.
The qualitative results are shown in Fig. 5. Training with ImageNet introduces
new types of artifacts as in image zebra of Fig. 5 while OST dataset benefits the
grass restoration.

4 The inﬂuence of training patch size

We observe that training a deeper network benefits from a larger patch size,
since an enlarged receptive ﬁeld helps the network to capture more semantic

information. We try training patch size 96 × 96, 128 × 128 and 192 × 192 on
models with 16 RBs and 23 RRDBs (larger model capacity). The training curves
(evaluated on Set5 with RGB channels) are shown in Fig. 6.

It is observed that both models benefit from larger training patch size. More-
over, the deeper model achieves more improvement (∼0.12dB) than the shallower
one (∼0.04dB) since larger model capacity is capable of taking full advantage of
larger training patch size.

However, larger training patch size costs more training time and consumes
more computing resources. As a trade-oﬀ, we use 192 × 192 for PSNR-oriented
methods and 128 × 128 for perceptual-driven methods.
